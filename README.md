Caesar Solver is a very basic python app that allows the user to either encrypt or decrypt a text using the Caesar Cipher technique.

The interface is using tkinter, which comes pre-installed with the Python installer binaries for Mac OS X and the Windows platform. 
So for Linux users, you have to install it manually by getting the package named python3-tk (or python-tk, depending on your python version).

This application has been designed for educational and training purposes only, I am well aware that it is far from perfect.
